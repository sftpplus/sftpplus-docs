Changing the admin credentials of the default administrator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the default `admin` credentials, go to the `Administrators`
section.

Select the account, then edit both username and password.
Make sure to apply all changes.

To create a new administrator account, select `Add administrator`, then
configure its username and password.
Ensure that this account is enabled and that the default `admin` account is
disabled as shown in the screenshot below:

For security purposes, the default configuration has no accounts
enabled for file transfer services.
You can enable the sample accounts or create your own accounts.
