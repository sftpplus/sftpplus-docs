Banning users
=============

A `deny-username` authentication method can be used to block/deny
authentication for a configured list of denied users.

You can use it for file transfer services, as well as for the Web Manager
service.

..  note::
    Add this authentication method as the first one in the list of
    active authentication methods to make sure the users are not
    authenticated earlier by other authentication methods.
