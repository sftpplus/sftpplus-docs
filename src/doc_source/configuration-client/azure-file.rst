Azure File Service
==================

An `azure-file` location provides access over HTTPS to the
Azure File Service of an Azure Storage account.

The files stored in Azure File Service shares are accessible via the
SMB protocol and HTTP API.
Azure Files is specifically a network file system.
SFTPPlus will use the HTTPS-based API to manage the files.
