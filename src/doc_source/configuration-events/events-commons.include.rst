         * Leave empty to handle all events.
:From version: 2.10.0
:Description:
    Define a comma separated list of event ids to have the event handler
    triggered only for those events.

    When you want to have it triggered for all the events,
    excepting a few events you should prefix each event id with the exclamation
    mark (!).

    Leave it empty to handle all events.

    ..  note::
        Combining the two methods is not supported as the same result
        can be achieved by allowing only the desired events, all the others
        will be ignored.


groups
------

:Default value: ''
:Optional: Yes
:Values: * Comma separated list of event groups.
         * Comma separated list of event groups
           starting with an exclamation mark.
         * Empty.
:From version: 3.39.0
:Description:

    except for the ones from a set of groups,
    prefix the group names with the exclamation mark (!).

    An event can be a member of one or multiple groups.
    The event is handled if any of its groups is found in the list
    of configured allowed groups.
    The event is not handled if any of its groups is found in the list

    Leave it empty to handle events from all groups.

    excepting a few events you should prefix each username with the exclamation
    mark (!).

    Leave it empty to handle events from any users or events which are
    not associated with any user.


components
----------

:Default value: ''
:Optional: Yes
:Values: * Comma separated list of UUIDs.
         * Comma separated list of UUIDs starting with an exclamation mark.
         * Leave empty to handle all events.
:From version: 3.18.0
:Description:
    Comma separated list of component UUIDs for which events are handled by
    this event handler.

    When you want to have it triggered for all the events,

         * Comma-separated list of UUIDs
         * `all`
:Description:

    When left empty, it will only handle events emitted by the local SFTPPlus server.

    When set to `all`, it will handle events from all SFTPPlus servers.

    It can be configured with one or multiple SFTPPlus server UUIDs.


source_addresses
----------------

:Default value: Empty

data_filter
-----------

:Default value: ''
:Optional: Yes
:Values: * Comma-separated list of data member names and filter expressions.
         * Multiple expressions, one per line (Since 4.29.0)
         * Leave empty to handle all events.
:From version: 3.22.0
:Description:
    Comma separated definition with the name of attribute data member and the targeted matching expression.

    Data member names are configured with insensitive cases.

    For more details about the available expressions see the
    :doc:`matching expression documentation.
    </configuration/matching-expression>`

    The following example will extract the value to be matched/filtered from the `path` data member of the event.
    The extracted value is then matched against the ``*/folderA/*`` globbing expression::

        [event-handlers/b904ed23-a234-4ccf-8abd-edcae4d3324f]
        data_filter = path, */folderA/*

    See :doc:`the usage instructions </guides/event-handlers>` for more operational details.

    You can filter based on multiple data members using multiple rules.
    Each rule is defined on a separate line.

    In the following example, events are triggered only if they are uploaded into the directory named ``reports-A`` with a size of 0 bytes (empty file)::

        [event-handlers/b904ed23-a234-4ccf-8abd-edcae4d3324f]
        data_filter =
            path, */reports-A/*
            size, 0

    Leave this configuration empty to not filter based on the event's attached data,
    and handle events regardless of their data attributes.

:Values: * An integer number greater than 0.
         * `0` Disabled.

    The event handler will no longer stop regardless of the number of errors
    encountered.
