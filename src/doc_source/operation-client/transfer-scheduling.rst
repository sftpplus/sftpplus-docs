Transfers scheduling
====================

..  contents:: :local:


Introduction
------------

A transfer can be configured to be active all the time
or be active based on a simple scheduler.

The scheduler available in SFTPPlus allows you to define transfer start and transfer stop events in a 24-hour interval, weekly interval or monthly interval.

The current scheduler does not know whether the current day is a working day or a national holiday.

It only knows about the current time of the day and the current day of the week or month.

..  note::
    There is no support for daylight saving time changes or time zone changes.

    The duration until the next scheduled action is always computed using the
    current time zone.

    If you change the time zone of your operating system, you will need to restart SFTPPlus.

To create a scheduled transfer,
you will have to define the start and stop actions at different hours across a day or week.

There are 3 types of schedulers available for transfers:

* daily - start or stop every single day.
* weekly - start or stop based on the day of the week.
* monthly - start or stop based on the day of the month.

You can't define a scheduler using a mix of weekly and monthly based actions.

Get in touch if you want a transfer with more complex scheduling rules.


Daily
-----

The daily scheduler allows to define start or stop actions that will be triggered every single day.

For example, to have the transfer start at 10:00, and stop at 14:00 each day,
you can use this configuration::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = 10:00-start, 14:00-stop

You can define multiple start and stop events within the day.
To have the transfer start daily at 10:00, stop at 14:00,
restart at 17:00, and stop at 18:00, use::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = 10:00-start, 14:00-stop, 17:00-start, 18:00-stop

You can also have the scheduler extended over two consecutive days.
To have the transfer start daily at 23:00 and stop the next day at 01:00, use::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = 23:00-start, 01:00-stop


Weekly
------

The weekly scheduler, allows defining actions for different days within the week.

For defining actions on different days throughout the week, add the name of the day before the time value.

An action that starts and stops each day, can be configured as::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = Monday-10:00-start, Monday-14:00-stop
               Tuesday-10:00-start, Tuesday-14:00-stop
               Wednesday-10:00-start, Wednesday-14:00-stop
               Thursday-10:00-start, Thursday-14:00-stop
               Friday-10:00-start, Friday-14:00-stop
               Saturday-10:00-start, Saturday-14:00-stop
               Sunday-10:00-start, Sunday-14:00-stop

To have a transfer start at 10:00 and stop at 14:00 every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, use::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = Monday-10:00-start, Monday-14:00-stop
               Wednesday-10:00-start, Wednesday-14:00-stop
               Friday-10:00-start, Friday-14:00-stop

You can also have start and stop events spanning different days.
To have a transfer that is active from Monday to Wednesday and then again
active from Friday to Saturday, use::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = Monday-10:00-start, Wednesday-18:00-stop
               Friday-10:00-start, Saturday-18:00-stop

As with the `daily scheduler` you can define multiple actions within the same day.
Below is the configuration for a transfer that will start twice each Monday and will be active for 4 hours each time::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = Monday-10:00-start, Monday-14:00-stop
               Monday-18:00-start, Monday-22:00-stop


Monthly
-------

The monthly scheduler allows defining actions for different days within the month.

For defining actions on different days throughout the month, add the number of the day before the time value.

For example, to have an action that is active on the 1st and 15th day of each month use::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = month_day_1-10:00-start, month_day_1-14:00-stop
               month_day_15-10:00-start, month_day_15-14:00-stop


You can define multiple actions within the same day.
Below is the configuration for a transfer that will start twice each 25th day of the month and will be active for 4 hours each time::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = month_day_25-10:00-start, month_day_25-14:00-stop
               month_day_25-18:00-start, month_day_25-22:00-stop

To schedule an event for the last day of the month, use the explicit configuration::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = month_day_last-10:00-start, month_day_last-14:00-stop

Scheduling on the 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st days of the month is not supported.
This is due to the ambiguity of executing these events for months that don't have these days.
Get in touch if you need to schedule on these days.


Clock drift correction
----------------------

..  FIXME:4027:
    Align changes_poll_interval with the schedule

The transfer's `changes_poll_interval` is not aligned with the schedule.
We are currently working on improving this to align the interval with the schedule.

For example, the configuration below will schedule to check files every
2 hours (or 7200 seconds) between 8AM and 6PM::

    [transfers/6b775eec-f98b-4527-811f-fd8c5c71a028]
    schedule = 08:00-start, 18:00-stop
    changes_poll_interval = 7200

If the transfer was started at ``13:35``, it will do a check at ``13:35``
instead of what you might expect to be done at ``14:00``
The next check will be scheduled for ``15:35``.
