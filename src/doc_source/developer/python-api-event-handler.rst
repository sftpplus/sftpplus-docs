Python API Event Handler
========================

..  contents:: :local:


Introduction
------------

SFTPPlus allows developers to write custom event handlers using the
Python programming language.

The handlers are execute in separate independent processes / CPU cores,
without shared memory.
This is why the `handle()` method of the extension needs to be a
`@staticmethod` and always received the configuration.

The handler is initialized multiple time.
One instance is created in the main process and extra instances are created
for each CPU.

A single extension instance can have the `onStart(configuration)` / `onStop()`
method called multiple times during its lifetime.
`onStart(configuration)` and `onStop()` methods are only called for the
instance running in the main process.

Most custom extension are created to only handle a few event IDs.
You can set the list of event IDs that can be handled by your extension via the `TARGET_EVENTS` instance member.
The `TARGET_EVENTS` is accessed after `onStart(configuration)`.

The code for the event handler needs to be placed in a Python file (module)
inside the `extension/` folder from the SFTPPlus installation folder.

You can find an extensive example inside the `extension/demo_event_handler.py`
folder of the default SFTPPlus installation.

Below is an example extension code that is also used to document the
available API and functionalities.

..  literalinclude:: ../../extension/demo_event_handler.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

This event handler can be configured as::

    [event-handlers/56df1d0a-78c6-11e9-a2ff-137be4dbb9a8]
    enabled = yes
    type = extension
    name = python-extension

    entry_point = python:extensions.demo_event_handler.DemoEventHandler

    configuration = some-free-text-configuration


Execution queue
---------------

SFTPPlus will only handle in parallel N events, where N is based on
the number of CPUs available to the OS.

All the other events required to be handled by the extensions are placed
into a queue.

The extension is called to handle the event only when there are free CPUs.

To prevent misconfiguration, there is a hard limit of 10 minutes for how long
an event can stay in the queue and for processing the event.


Event data members
------------------

The event object received in the handler has the following structure.
