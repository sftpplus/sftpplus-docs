This is the SFTPPlus Purview SDK extension.

Sub-directories and files in this directory should be copied in the
SFTPPlus base installation directory.

On Windows, the C++ redistributables must be installed.
Get them from https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe.

Configure the SFTPPlus Purview extension using the example below.
This configuration checks that files are uploaded in a directory whose
name is matching the label name.
If a file is uploaded without a label,
it is automatically labelled with the name of the
parent directory.
Once their labels are validated, files are moved to the "Download" folder.
For any errors, placeholder files are generated in the "Error" folder.
