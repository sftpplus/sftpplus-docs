Events Reference
================

While SFTPPlus operates it generate a set of events based on the performed operations.
These events can be used for auditing, logging, or notifications as well as for triggering various operations on the transferred files.

Each event is member of one or multiple event groups.
The groups are used to indicate the **log level** as well as various other characteristics like protocol type or security level.

For configuring SFTPPlus to react when an event occurs, see
:doc:`the dedicated page for Event Handlers</configuration-events/index>`.
