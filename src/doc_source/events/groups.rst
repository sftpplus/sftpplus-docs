Server Event Groups
===================

The server's events are grouped in **event groups**.
Grouping facilitates operations on multiple events, and is done based
according to various criteria.

Below is the reference of available Server Event Groups.






Administration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events emitted by actions done by local administrators or by the process itself. All events have an `avatar` data field.




Analytics
^^^^^^^^^


Events emitted by the internal analytics engine.




Authenticated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events emitted by authenticated accounts. All events have an `avatar` data field.




Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events emitted during the authentication process.




Client-side
^^^^^^^^^^^


Events emitted by the client side operations.




Compat
^^^^^^


Operating system compatibility layer.




Component-activation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events emitted as part of the activation/deactivation/start/stop of a component.




Failure
^^^^^^^


Events generated by a failed operation. Any failed operation, critical or non critical.




Failure-critical
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events generated by a critical failure. This event should not occur under normal operation.




Failure-high
^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events generated by failures with a high impact on server operation. This can be configuration or operational errors.




Failure-specific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Failures which don't have details attached.




File-operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events generated by file handling operations. They can be both server-side or client-side operations. When the events are generated by a server-side component, operating in a chrooted/locked filesytem, the `path` data field is set to the virtual path of the file on which the operation is performed. The 'real_path' data field is set to the full path of that file, as present to the normal file system.




Ftp
^^^


Events generated by FTP/FTPS file transfers client and server side.




Http
^^^^


Events generated by HTTP/HTTPS  file transfers client and server side.




Informational
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events informing that an action is going to be performed, or containing details about the service state.




Local-manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events generated by Web Manager service.




Location-operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events generated by operations on location. All events have a `path` data field populated with the local path of the file on which the operation is performed. The path can be local or remote.




Monitor
^^^^^^^


Events generated by the monitor service.




Operation-append
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


File content was appended.




Operation-create-folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


A new folder was created.




Operation-delete
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


A file or folder was deleted.




Operation-read
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The content of a file was read.




Operation-rename
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


A file or folder was renamed or moved.




Operation-write
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The content of a file was written.




Operational
^^^^^^^^^^^


Events generated by internal server functions.




Process
^^^^^^^


Events generated by process itself while not associated with any account, administrator or remote peer. All events have an `avatar` data field.




Session
^^^^^^^


Event generated by opening and closing connection and establishing authenticated sessions for clients. All events have a `peer` data field populated with the host/port address of the client connection.




Smb
^^^


Events generated by SMB file transfers client and server side.




Ssh
^^^


Events generated by SSH file transfers client and server side. Common SSH services, and SCP and SFTP specific events.




Success
^^^^^^^


Events generated by a successful operation.




Transfer
^^^^^^^^


Events generated by a transfer operation. These are only the auxiliary events emitted during a transfer, and not actual client-side file transfer protocol operations.




Transfer-job
^^^^^^^^^^^^


Events generated for the transfer job of a single file or a batch of files operation. These are only the auxiliary events emitted during a transfer, and not actual client-side file transfer protocol operations.
