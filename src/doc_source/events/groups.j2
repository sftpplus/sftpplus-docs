Server Event Groups
===================

The server's events are grouped in **event groups**.
Grouping facilitates operations on multiple events, and is done based
according to various criteria.

Below is the reference of available Server Event Groups.

{#
Unpack the group_id and use Jinja dictsort.
#}

{% for group_id, group in groups|dictsort %}
{%- if not group.name.startswith('__') %}

{#
Add a new subheading for each group_id name and capitalize the first character.
#}
{{ group.name | capitalize }}
{{ '^' * group.name|count }}

{#
Add the group_id's description underneath the group ID section.
#}
{{ group.description }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
