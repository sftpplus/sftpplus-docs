=======

SFTPPlus is specially designed to operate on all major server operating systems and major CPUs.

It is based on Python3 and OpenSSL, which are distributed with the application and are constantly updated to include both security and performance fixes.

If you are looking for an operating system not listed
in the :doc:`Supported Operating Systems</installation/requirements>` section,
get in contact with the support team.
It is very probable that SFTPPlus already works on that OS, it's just that we don't do continuous testing for that platform.
