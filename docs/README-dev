Documentation Development
==========================

Documentation is using ReStructuredText format.
It is converted into HTML using Python Sphinx.

We generate documentation for 2 use cases:

* website integrated into public website.
* standalone, include into distributable for offline and Web Manager access.

The documentation website has Netlify as a frontend via the
chevah/sftpplus.com repo and site.
The actual documentation is hosted on yeovil.sftpplus.com VM on vultr.
Netlify will reverse-proxy the content to make it look like a single site.

For standalone version, static files (images, fonts, CSS) are copied from the
website package.
The integrated version is triggered by the publish process.
The standalone version is triggered by the distributable build process.

The following annotation classes are available:

* seealso - green
* tip - green
* note - blue - use to highlight a paragraph.
* danger - strong red
* warning - red
* attention - yellow
* admonition:: Since Version - no color yet

The following tags are available for guide pages:

* client-side - for client-side functionalities and operations
* server-side - for server-side functionalities and operations
* file-transfer - for file transfer related operations, regardless of
  client and server side
* security - for security related topics
* since-version - for informing when the functionality was added

You can build the documentation using the following command.
Files are
generated in build-py3/doc/html::

    $ ./pythia.sh documentation_standalone


Page title capitalization
-------------------------

* The name of top-level pages should only have first word capitalized.
* Sub-pages should only have the first word capitalized,
  unless other words are proper nouns.


Images
------

Images should be copied to the 'docs/static' folder.
Don't use the 'docs/_static' folder as that folder is used by Sphinx.
Once the documentation is build, the images are copied to
'build/doc/html/_images'.
In this way, the images that are not used in the documentation are not
copied to the final site.


Intra-documentation links
-------------------------

Always use Sphinx references to link to pages or sections.
Don't use raw URLs.
In this way, any dead links are automatically detected.

Link to a page::

    You can use it inline with :doc:`link text</link-target>`.

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`package-dependents` Install and Update
        :link-type: doc
        :link: installation/index

Link to an arbitrary section. Use `.. _example-reference:` inside the
targeted document.
Then link it as::

    You can use it inline with :ref:`link text<example-reference>`.

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`moon` Event groups
        :link-type: ref
        :link: example-reference

        This section describes all the available event groups.



Website integration
-------------------

The version design to integrate into website can be generated using this
command, but it is much harder to test. To test, you will need to publish it
or run `chevah/sftpplus.com` repo on the local system::

    $ ./pythia.sh documentation_website
    Build and start sftpplus.com website on your local system and then
    copy the latest docs
    $ rm -rf ../sftpplus.com/venv/deploy/documentation/sftpplus/latest
    $ cp -r build-*/doc/html \
        ../sftpplus.com/venv/deploy/documentation/sftpplus/latest
    You can now get the docs at
    http://localhost:8080/documentation/sftpplus/latest
