Administrators
==============

Administrators are dedicated to accessing the
:doc:`Web Manager administration service </configuration/local-manager>`.
They cannot be used for file transfer operations.

To simplify configuration management for a large number of administrators,
the administrators are associated with one or more roles.

This allows, for example, to easily disable access for all administrators associated with a particular role by simply disabling the role instead of having to disable every administrator.

Adding a new administrator via Web Manager
------------------------------------------

Administrators can be added or changed via Web Manager below.

Adding a new administrator via text configuration
-------------------------------------------------

Adding a new administrator is done by creating a new section inside the configuration file.
The name of the section should be prefixed with ``administrators/`` and followed by the administrator's UUID.

The administrator's UUID can be any unique string used to identify the administrator.
Once defined, the UUID should not be changed.

For more information, please see
:doc:`the dedicated UUID documentation </configuration/introduction>`.

An administrator can be an application-level account defined for accessing the Web Manager or a local operating system account belonging to an operating system group associated with a role.

For example, to add a new administrator named **sa-admin**::

    [administrators/804aab78-70c0-4e1d-8480-4979e169a0a2]
    name = sa-admin
    enabled = Yes
    description = Administrator account for our super admin.
    password = $5$rounds=1000$utwEAUxeFBXSF0Uf$klQTAMRygQfijPXMYZCddVug
    role = 404aab78-70c0-4e1d-8480-4979e169a0a4

..  note::
    The server does not support authenticating operating system administrators that are used for multiple roles.
    In this case, the result is undefined.

..  note::
    Administrator names and passwords longer than 150 characters are not allowed by SFTPPlus.
    Generating passwords longer than 128 characters is not possible either.
    These restrictions prevent denial of service attacks.


Options for administrators

The following configuration options are available for administrators.

    Example::

        [administrators/92ad5b32-d8d7-4ed8-94e1-dbb9f01383f4]
        description = Administrator from the SA team.

        name = sa-operator


password
^^^^^^^^

:Default value: Empty
:Optional: Yes
:From version: 2.1.0
:Values: * Password encrypted using a one-way cryptographic hash function.
         * Empty.
:Description:
    This option specifies the password used for validating the
    credentials for this administrator.

    It is stored encrypted using the cryptographic hash function SHA-256.

    To get the hashed password please check how to :ref:`generate encrypted
    passwords using admin-commands <generate-encrypted-password>`.

    When the password is left empty,
    the administrator will not be able to authenticate,
    even if the `enabled` option is set to `yes`.


source_ip_filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:Default value: Empty
:Optional: Yes
:From version: 4.14.0
:Values: * Source IP/CIDR access control rules (since 4.22.0)
         * Empty

:Description:
    This option defines the access control rules based on which administrators are allowed or denied authentication.

    Allowed IP/CIDR (IPv4 or IPv6) addresses are defined using access control rules, one rule per line.
    All rules use this format: `ACTION IP-OR-CIDR`

    `ACTION` is any of the following values:

    * `allow` - allows access from IP or CIDR
    * `deny` - denies access from IP or CIDR

    The administrator configuration option is similar to the account configuration.
    For more details, see the
    :doc:`account configuration </configuration-auth/accounts>` documentation page.

    For examples of how to use the access control rules see the :doc:`authentication </operation/authentication>` documentation page.

    The first UUID is the primary role of this administrator.

    Updating this configuration doesn't impact the sessions of already authenticated administrators, which continue to use the old configuration value.
    The new value is only used for new authentications.
