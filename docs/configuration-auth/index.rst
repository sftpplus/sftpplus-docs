Authentication, Users and Admins
================================

An authentication method configuration provides the required information to
allow SFTPPlus to use a specific method in order to authenticate
file transfer accounts and administration account.


..  note::
    Not all authentication method types support authenticating the
    administrators for the Web Manager service.

The identity configuration defines the users, groups, administrators and
roles created as part of the SFTPPlus application.

For these users and administrators the full life-cycle is managed by SFTPPlus.

The sections below will guide you through the available authentication methods
and how to configure them.
