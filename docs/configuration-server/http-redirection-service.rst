HTTP redirection
================

The `http-redirect` service allows to configure an HTTP server with the sole
purpose of redirecting to another service on a different port.

Introduction
------------

This can be used to redirect HTTP requests to an HTTPS-only file transfer
service.

Below is an example of such a redirection service::

    [services/9ac4-1054-f0e4]
    name = HTTP to HTTPs redirection
    type = http-redirect
    address = 0.0.0.0
    port = 80
    redirect_url = https://your.domain.tld/home/
    headers = Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=1607040; includeSubDomains

Below you can find the list of available configuration options.
