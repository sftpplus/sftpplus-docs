Notes for ISO27001
##################

According to the `Good Practice Guide <https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/protective-monitoring-hmg-ict-systems-gpg-13>`_ :

*ISO27001 Compliance (reference [e]) - if the organisation is intending,
formally or informally, to comply with ISO27001 then the controls in the GPG13
Guide directly satisfy the group of all 6 controls under A.10.10 (Monitoring)
and A.15.3 (Information systems audit considerations).*

To help assist those with Protective Monitoring obligations, we have created
:doc:`a dedicated section to outline which portion of SFTPPlus functionality
applies to the controls in the GPG13</standards/gpg13>`.

Further details are available from the ISO website in regards to the
`ISO/IEC 27001 - Information security management <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso27001>`_
standards.

Please note that this page is not a confirmation of ISO/IEC 27001 certification.
