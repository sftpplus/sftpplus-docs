An `ftps` location provides access to an Explicit FTPS server.

This page is a reference documentation for the configuration options available when connecting to a secure FTPS Explicit server.

For more information about how to implement FTP based transfers,
see the separate documentation page for :doc:`implementing FTP transfers</operation-client/ftp>`.

Check the separate reference documentation for
