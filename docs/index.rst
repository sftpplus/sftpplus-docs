SFTPPlus documentation
======================


Introduction
------------

SFTPPlus is a Managed File Transfer (:ref:`MFT<term-mft>`) software, with support for protocols like: FTPS, SFTP, HTTPS, AS2, and cloud providers like Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon S3.

It operates as standalone software, running as a background service,
without requiring any additional dependencies,
such as a database or web server.

The configuration is done via a text file, which can be edited using any text editor,
or via an embedded web-based configuration tool, which is accessible via any modern web browser.

Security, correctness, easy-of-use, and file transfer capabilities are all important factors and we focus on them in this
order.

Using the documentation
-----------------------

This technical documentation includes instructions for performing installation, upgrade,
configuration, and operational procedures.

The information is written for administrators of Windows or Unix-like systems, familiar with file transfer protocols.

For a less technical description of SFTPPlus capabilities, check our `general website pages <https://www.sftpplus.com/articles/category/solutions/>`_.


We use the following methods for highlights:

A note supplements and highlights additional information.
When ignored, the information presented here will not have any
negative consequences.

Below is an example of a note message.

..  note::
    It is highly recommended to define an explicit group
    (other than the `DEFAULT_GROUP`) for each application account.
    This will make the configuration file much easier to understand by removing
    any implicit behaviour associated with an unspecified group.

A warning is information which should not be ignored.
The information should be understood, as otherwise it can lead to
irreversible actions and undesirable consequences.

Below is an example of a warning message.

..  warning::
    Depending on your architecture, this could change the service to make the
    default administrative account accessible over the Internet.
    Care must be taken to ensure that the default administrative account is
    altered or deleted.

You will notice certain terms will be colour-coded `grey` or ``blue``.

`Verbatim` values represent terms which should be used exactly as documented.
For example, a configuration option such as `home_folder_path` is a verbatim
value.
It also describes fixed values like `disabled`, `yes` or `no`.


The ``Input`` values serve as an example and we expect them to be altered
before being used in a certain configuration.

For example, ``c:\Path\${USER}`` is expected to be modified to suit the
environment used by a specific deployment, like **E:\\FTP-Files\\${USER}**.

In the documentation you will find scripts,
text configuration examples and commands to provide further guidance to our readers.

Example of system administrator commands::

    $ ./bin/admin-commands.sh start --configuration non-root-server.ini
    # ./bin/admin-commands.sh start --configuration root-server.ini
    CMD> service-start.bat --configuration windows-server.ini

Example of a single configuration option defined inside our configuration
file::

    [section-name/03288e36-cf6b-4bd5-a9be-f421372f17e6]
    rotate_count = 5

Example of a command sent to our interactive client shell::

    > set username mary

Example of code in the developer documentation::

    {
      "account": {
        "home_folder_path": "/local/path/for/account",
        "uuid": "ebfbee04-17be-4d9f-b7fc-20ffed6a61a8",
        "create_home_folder": true,
        "create_home_folder_owner": "ude_team",
        "create_home_folder_group": "partners"
        "home_folder_structure": [['/some-child'], ['/another-child']]
        }
    }
