Interoperability with anti-viruses
==================================

SFTPPlus can function suitably when anti-virus applications are installed
to protect the environment on the machine.

Most anti-virus applications have a real-time protection component that will
scan files on creation, when accessed, and on execution.
These operations will not affect the overall performance of the system.

..  warning::
    In order to ensure that no false positives are reported by the anti-virus
    applications, please consider adding the SFTPPlus process -
    ``/Install/Path/lib/sftpplus-worker.exe`` -
    to the anti-virus exception list.
